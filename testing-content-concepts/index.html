<p>Similar to testing UX designs, testing content at important points throughout a project lets you get feedback from people and ensure your content works. If your content isn't working, you can adjust the content and test again until it does. By testing throughout your project, you save yourself the pain, frustration, and cost of reaching the end of a project only to find the content does not work for people.</p><h3>Beyond Usability</h3><p>For content, usability is whether someone can find, read, and understand the content. To accomplish our business goals, we often need content to be more than findable, readable, and understandable. Content might need to engage, influence, or support decisions.</p><h3>Balancing <em>What </em>with <em>Why</em></h3><p>Perhaps the greatest value of testing content is that it lets you gather more qualitative data to complement your quantitative data such as analytics. It is difficult, if not impossible, to measure the effectiveness of content using quantitative data alone. [1] If you test content throughout a project, you assimilate a more complete understanding of whether it’s achieving your goals. While analytics can tell you plenty about<em>what</em>is happening with your content, qualitative testing helps you understand<em>why</em>it is happening. For example, analytics can tell you that a certain page has a high bounce rate. Interviews with people can tell you that the content doesn’t cover the topics they need or the content’s tone is lifeless or the images look unprofessional—and give you insights that can help you fix the problems.</p><p>Testing content with people throughout a project lets you <em>triangulate </em>qualitative feedback with expert review and quantitative data—from analytics, call metrics, or multivariate testing. Where you see similarities, patterns, or connections between all three, you’ll find the strongest insights. Triangulation is a widely recognized research principle in the social sciences, where strict, empirical tests that follow the scientific method—complete with a control group, variable group, and statistically significant results—are often not possible. Instead of trying to answer a question through one scientific experiment, triangulation answers the question through the combined results of several methods. Figure 1 shows how triangulation can apply to content.</p><h2>What Is a Content Concept?</h2><blockquote><p>A content concept is a mockup or draft of your content. I find testing at three different levels of fidelity useful, depending on what qualities of the content I want to test.</p></blockquote><p>A content concept is a mockup or draft of your content. I find testing at three different levels of fidelity useful, depending on what qualities of the content I want to test. The higher the fidelity, the more variables you can test. However, it can be harder to identify which variable is causing your results. (See “How Do I Test a Content Concept” later in this column.)</p><h2>What Content Should I Test?</h2><p>You probably can’t test every single piece of content that might be a part of your project, so you’ll need to test a sample. I find the best approaches to sampling content are<em>critical case sampling</em>and<em>common case sampling</em>.</p><h3>Critical Case Sampling</h3><p>Select the instances of content that are<em>most</em>important to your project goals. For instance, if your project involves convincing people to sign up for something, you should test the content for the sign-up module or landing page.</p><h3>Common Case Sampling</h3><p>Choose the types of content that comprise the majority of the content for your Web site or interactive user experience. For example, if the goal of your Web site is to provide credible healthcare information to improve people’s healthcare decisions, test the content for a typical healthcare topic.</p><h2>When Should I Test Content Concepts?</h2><p>Test content concepts at the beginning of your project. Rachel Lovinger, Content Strategy Lead at Razorfish, offers a helpful visual showing the evolution of content strategy throughout the project process in Figure 2. [2]. <i>Concept is part of the early discovery phase.</i></p><p>The specific approach you should take to testing concepts might vary, depending on your project, but I find these basic steps always apply. If you have solid experience in testing designs, you simply need to make a few adjustments to focus your testing on content. However, if you have <em>not conducted such testing before, I recommend that you read a book, attend a conference, or take a class about usability or similar types of testing.</em></p><ol><li>Identify your testing goals.</li></ol><p>The overall purpose of testing a content concept is to figure out what content strategy you should follow throughout your project. Consequently, make sure your specific testing goals align with the project goals. For instance, if the goal of your project is to help people make better health decisions as they travel, make sure your test covers related content and explores whether it influences people’s decisions.</p><ol><li>Choose critical or common content cases to test.</li></ol><p>When choosing the samples of content you’ll test, use the sampling method that makes the most sense for your project and testing goals. (See “What Content Should I Test?”)</p><ol><li>Create concepts that explore the right qualities.</li></ol></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">Cureface</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
